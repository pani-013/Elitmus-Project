# How to setup the project ? 
For the current phase of the project, since only the front end is implemented. You have to just download the files in your desired folder. Then unzip the files. 
Although pages like main page, login page, register page exist, since backend could not be implemented. No need to interact with them (although they have been linked in a manner that a normal user would go through). 

1. Open "game trial 1" folder.  
2. Open the "puzzles" folder. 
3. Open the "Puzzle 1" folder inside "puzzles".
4. Open the "puzzle1" file, which should open in the brower.
